## ABSTRACT - 10 Point
> Nama Kode ini berasal dari huruf Ibrani pertama, terakhir, kedua, dan kedua hingga terakhir (  Aleph  -  Taw  -  Bet  -  Shin  ). XGUIHG{4gy4hs_x0w3} Coba Decodekan Pesan ini.
### Solution
Searching Aelph - Taw - Bet - Shin on the internet gave me online tools that will help me decode **Atbash Cipher**, which is probably the encryption this challenge wants me to decrypt.

The way this encryption works is by replacing the messages with the reverse of the alphabet. Like A will become Z and B will become Y and so on. There's a tool in CyberChef for this too.
