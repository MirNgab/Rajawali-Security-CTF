### Solution
Searching the name of the nation that used this code will only give us a brief history lesson. But when searching the code one by one, a wikipedia page will appear explaining NATO phonetic alphabet.

The given article is actually very helpful for decoding the challenge's message. The whole code basically revolve around this interesting alphabet:

As you can see, the correct letter can be shown by the first letter in the listed words. If we take that information, we can clearly start seeing the format of the flag is being shown:

**C**harlie **T**ango **F**oxtrot **R**omeo **S**ierra **T**ango

And all that's left is to translate the remaining code. For the words like "Four" or "Three", i assume that's just numbers since the letter F and T are already used by this NATO alphabet

**CTFRST{4LF4B3T_F0N3T1K}**
