### Solution
The way the name of the challenge and the description saying the word rabbit, i jump to the conclusion that this is Rabbit Encryption, there's a wikipedia talking about this encryption if you want to check it out.

One thing about this encryption is that, it is using key in which we need to either know what the key is or brute force our way in. Or we could just use this [online tool](https://www.codeeeee.com/en/encrypt/rabbit.html)

The site's probably do some brute forcing in the background so we technically going with the second choice i think? i don't want to think too much but at least we got the flag.
