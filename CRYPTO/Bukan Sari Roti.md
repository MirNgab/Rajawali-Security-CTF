# Bukan Sari Roti - 10 Points

### Solution
From the way the encrypted flag looks, my first thought was rotation like ROT13 but this time you only need to rotate it 10 because the description said the number 10. So let's just do that.

Ok, that was goofy, for some reason it didn't go well. My thoughts are still in the rotation encryption, so instead of following the information i got, i just rised up the rotation hoping it finally decrypted, in which it did.

I can't tell if CyberChef is broken and 10 is equal to 16 or the challenge is just pranking, but nonetheless we got the flag.
