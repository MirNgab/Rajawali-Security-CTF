The given ciphertext is very confusing at first because it looks like just a bunch of symbols and emojis that are being spammed around. But thankfully there's an online encryption identifier such as [this](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier)

It identified 5 possible encryption and there's one called Wingdings Font at the top of the list, clicking the name will redirect us to the decoder of the said encryption. Now all we need is to just decode our ciphertext

The letter in the flag needs to be lowercase in order to be valid, so make sure to do that.
