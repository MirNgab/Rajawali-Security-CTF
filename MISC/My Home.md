## My Home - 10 Point
> Cari aku di suatu rumah yang berada tak jauh dari sini!
### Solution
This one is a little bit confusing at first as we're basically given nothing but the fact that the description want us to find it. This is the tricky part and i almost forgot that this is not an OSINT Challenge.

It says that the house is not far from here which means it is hidden on this website. And it got me thinking about the flag that appears when you open this CTF web for the first time.
