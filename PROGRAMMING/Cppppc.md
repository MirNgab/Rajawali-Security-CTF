### Solution
This is something you need to do in C++ due to the cmath library, all we need is to fill the missing required headers and complete the rest of the code
```
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::cout << std::log(2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code will output the natural logarithm of 2
