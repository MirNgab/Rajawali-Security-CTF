### Solution
This is something you need to do in C++ due to the cmath library (though you can do this in C as well i think but, i'm just following the procedure here lol), all we need is to do now is to fill the missing required headers and complete the rest of the code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    std::cout << std::log(2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code will output the natural logarithm of 2
