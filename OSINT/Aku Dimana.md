_**Hint :**_ Pastebin
### Solution
So i went to Pastebin immediately after seeing the hint and tried to search Rajawali Security Team, in which i failed miserably because you need to login in order to do so, and i'm too lazy to login lol.

So my idea is to find the user through url, i just need to find the way to do it, so i started searching random username in pastebin through google search engine and found a roblox account and in the url, theres /u written.

I assume that's supposed to be where username will be put in the url, so i rewrite that roblox dude username with rajawalisecteam, hoping some list of notes or codes appear like the description said and it did.

Finding the flag might seems to be annoying with how many note or codes that are listed here but, there's one note that caught my attention by the name "Flag mu disini13"

The next problem is that the flag is encrypted, but it doesn't take too long for me to figure it out because the name of this note has 13 written on it, so i assume it's encrypted using ROT13, so yeah i dragged it to CyberChef and decode it using ROT13

Just change the square brackets into curly brackets and you got the flag
